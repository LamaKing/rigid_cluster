Superlubric interface design
==============================

Compute the interlocking potential between a periodic substrate and a finite-size adsorbate, in the rigid approximation.
The adsorbate is treated as a rigid body at a given orientation :math:`\theta` and center of mass (CM) position :math:`x_\mathrm{cm}, y_\mathrm{cm}`.

This package is a collection of functions implementing the above physical system and automating routines usually needed to study the static, dynamics and scaling laws of friction at nanoscale interfaces.
This software was developed at SISSA, Trieste, Italy in the group of Prof.
Erio Tosatti and Andrea Vanossi and based on the experiments by Xin Cao and Clemens Bechinger at Univeristy of Konstanz, Germany.
